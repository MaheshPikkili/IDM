Tcs Interview Questions

1) What is Identity and Access Management?
---------------------------------------

SailPoint IdentityIQ is an identity and access management solution for enterprise applications that delivers a wide variety
of IAM processes-including automated access certifications, policy management, access request and provisioning,
password management, and identity intelligence. Furthermore, IdentityIQ has a flexible connectivity model that simplifies the 
management of applications running in the datacenter or the cloud.

importance
-----------
Today there are many  products available  in the market providing IDM solution to enterprise applications.
Then what is new about the Sailpoint IdentityIQ?

Existing IDM products are IT focused and their efficiency mostly depends upon the IT helpdesk and the IT technical team.
Sailpoint aims at shifting more and more Identity & access processes from the IT technical team to the end users
so that the dependency is as less as possible on the technical team.
So we can say this product is more of Business focused as compared to other IDM products which are IT focused.
It has a single use interface as compared to the existing IDM products having multiple interfaces with multiple contexts.

2) What are the lifecycle events in IAM?
--------------------------------------
To further simplifying user on-boarding, off-boarding, and other job changes within the enterprise, 
we can add event-based lifecycle management to automatically trigger access changes based on HR or other authoritative feeds.
1) create
2) Atribute Change
3) Manager Transfer
4) Native Chanage
5) Rule
6) Alert
Certifications
--------------
Event-Based Certifications  certify the entitlement information for the identities selected based on
events detected within IdentityIQ.

3) What are the differences between IdentityIQ version 6.4 and IdentityIQ version 7?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 7.0 introduced the option to split the provisioning plan into individual line-item components
during the approval process, 

For example, version 6.4
-------------------------
if the requester selected 5 entitlements together
in the cart, the provisioning of all 5 entitlements would occur at once, and only after the approvals for
all 5 entitlements had been completed. If one entitlement's owner was slow to respond, the other 4
entitlements would also have to wait to be provisioned until the fifth was approved or rejected.

In version 7.0,
--------------- 
the workflow can be configured to split the provisioning plan (the cart) into its component pieces
at any step in the approval process. If, for example, the approvalScheme is "manager,owner", the
manager approval could be left as one unit, but the owner approval could be processed per owner.
Then, each of the 5 entitlements can be provisioned as its approval gets completed.

4) Which are the target systems that you are aware of?
-------------------------------------------------------

Ldap , Active Directory, JDBC

5)Which OOTB connectors have you worked before?

Deleimeted file , jdbc, ladp(oud), Active Directory

6) Describe the steps for installing IdentityIQ.
------------------------------------------------

Step1:Take identity iq war file deploye in webapps identityiq folder
Step2: extract the identityiq war file by using the command jar -xvf identityiq.war enter 
then generating files
Step3: then navigate to bin and generate the script file by using command iiq schema
Step4: then navigate to database login to mysql db then enter user name and password
Step5: and create the iiq tables by using command source create_identityiq_tables.mysql
Step6: verify the script files by using command use identityiq; and show tables and its shown 204 tables
Step7: then navigate to bin directory then type iiq console and load the identityiq xml object by using command import init.xml
Step8: generating xml files
Step9: and also configure the lcm manager by using command import init_lcm.xml
Sten10: finally start the tomcat and login the application by using localhost:8080/identityiq

7)  What is refresh task and why it is needed?
-----------------------------------------------
1 Task are used to automate the processes which build, update, and maintain the information contained within IdentityIQ.

Identity refresh task
----------------------
IT is analyze the information collected for each identity to ensure that it is up-to-date and accurate. Among other things,
identity scans can detect and report on policy violations and trigger event certifications.

2)Run an Identity Refresh task with the Process Event option enabled to trigger the life cycle events for 
any changes detected since the last time the events were processed.

3)Refresh assigned, detected roles and promote additional entitlements  Creates provisioning requests
for IdentityIQ to add roles to identity cubes.

4)Provision assignments  Creates provisioning requests that apply to external applications.

5)Synchronize attributes--provision the identity mapping targets if thier values have changed


8)What is Group, Work Group and Population?

Groups
------
These are statically defined based off a single Identity attribute.
so thats way Run the task: Refresh Groups
we have to generate some groups based on the following Identity Attributes
we defined these Identity Attributes as group factories earlier when we defined the identity mappings
We will also be using rules to assign ownership to each group.
These groups can be used in reporting

Population
----------
use Advanced Analytics to define some populations based on specific criteria. 
Populations are similar to groups, except that they are driven off of multiple
search criteria whereas Groups are statically defined based off a single Identity attribute.

Groups and Populations are used for filtering in a number of places in the product. 
One of those is in reporting. Here we will run a report using a Group to narrow down the results

Work Group
----------
defining group of identities as a particular applcation owner

9)What is RBAC?
-------------------
Managing access of users using Roles in sailpoint is RBAC(Role Based Access Control)

10)  What is Policy Violation?
------------------------------

Policies are defined and used to monitor identities that are in violation of the policies.  

11) What is Entitlement or Permissions?  
---------------------------------------  
Entitlement
-----------
An entitlement is either a specific value for an account attribute, most commonly group membership, or a permission.

Entitlements fall into two categories: Permissions and Attributes. 
A Permission is a privilege, such as create, read, update, delete, and execute.
Attributes are customized user characteristics made up of an attribute/value pair, such as group/Administrators.

14)What are Detected and Assigned roles?
Business roles are Assigned roles
----------------------------------
IdentityIQ supports role mining to create both business and IT roles. 
Business role mining in IdentityIQ facilitates the creation of organizational groupings based on identity attributes, for example department, cost center or job title

IT roles roles are detected role
--------------------------------
IT roles typically model how application entitlements (or permissions) are logically grouped for streamlined access.  

15)How to onboard Active Directory?
------------------------------------
Step1: define new application
step2: given name, select owner, select correspoding conntector like active directoty
step3: configuration
step4: settings 
iqservice host:
iqserviceport 5050    

step5: domain configauration

  domain,user,password,server    

step6: account :search dn for accounts cn=users,dc idm, dc=in
step7: groups:search dn for groups dc=idm, dc=in 
step 8: test connection 
step 9: object type account
native object type :user
identity attribute: distiguishedName
DisplayAttribute: samAccountName

native object type :group
same like above
select member of to entitlement and managed   

run the account group aggregation taks 

16) What is SSL? 
Secure socket layer is a standard security protocol for enrypted links between a web server and browser in an online communication

17) How to import the Certificate to KeyStore?

Key Creation
-------------
To create or manage the keystore: navigate to the WEB-INF/bin folder and start the IdentityIQ KeyStore console with the keystore command:
1.Navigate to the WEB-INF/bin folder and start the IdentityIQ Keystore console with the keystore command
iiq keystore
> addKey ?
Generate a new encryption key (y/n)? ?
y ?
Generating a new encryption key for keystore?
[/var/tomcat/webapps/access governance suite/WEB-INF/classes/spt.dat]. ?
New encrpytion key successfully saved to keystore. ?
All application servers must be restarted for changes to take effect. ?
>
The list command displays the newly created key:
> list ?
Listing contents for keystore?
[/var/tomcat/webapps/iiq6/WEB-INF/classes/iiq.dat]. ?
KeyAlias Algorithm Format Object ?
?
2 AES RAW javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec@fffe81cd ?
>

By default the files are stored in the following location:
keystorePassword = WEB-INF/classes/iiq.cfg ?
keystore = WEB-INF/classes/iiq.dat

If you run more than one instance of IdentityIQ, you must place the following files in the
WEB-INF/classes folder of each instance, or in the location specified in iiq.properties.

To select the newly created key, use 2. If multiple keys are in the keystore, use any available higher
number.
 To select the original default key use 1 or nothing.

25.        What is the difference between Account and Group Aggregation?
ANS:       Account aggregation scans the application information and it loads users and entielments and it correlate users and entitlements
           Account group aggregation scans the appllication details and aggregate  account  groups and application group attributes used for group certification and displaying group information.

26.        What is Delta Aggregation? Explain with an example.
ANS:       Delta aggregation is used to aggregate only those accounts which are changed since the last aggregation.

27.        What is Partition? Explain with an example.
ANS:       if we have lot of identites to aggregate then it makes the server loaded then those identities are splitted into parts called instances then those are aggregated separetely as threads this is called partitioning.

1. How can we develop Custom Task?

Ans: If you have any requirement for which you have to create a custom task with custom attribute then you can follow the below steps, 
In our XML file Executor must be fully qualified name of our custom class and the the custom task type should be Generic type, template="true" is set to get the TaskDefinition listed in New Task List . Our custom class should extends  sailpoint.task.AbstractTaskExecutor and override the method to implement our logic These are the methods from superclass we have to provide the our logic in this methods 

 public void execute(SailPointContext paramSailPointContext, TaskSchedule paramTaskSchedule,
                                        TaskResult paramTaskResult, Attributes<String, Object> paramAttributes) 

      2.    public boolean terminate() 

 Compile the class file and copy it inside \webapps\identityiq\WEB-INF\classes\sailpoint\custom\task and restart the tomcat

2. Have you work Custom report?

Ans: customer-specific reports developed by or specifically for a single customer through a custom TaskDefinition specification.In IdentityIQ, a report is essentially executed as a specialized task The root element of a report is a <TaskDefinition> element. The executor specifies which class processes this task definition to run the report.

DataSource: is used for retrieving the data from the database to reports by using the query and we can specify the query in three ways i.e JavaDatasource,HQl,Filter. In this three data sources Filter is easy and most commonly used one.Next common datasource is java datasource . Java datasource class must implement sailpoint.reporting.datasource.JavaDataSource interface, and we have to provide the implementation for all 10 methods  and HQl is another datasource it is used in rare circumstances. This should be used when the report developer well known about HQL.

Ans:	readonly: if you put this option we can not be edit the attribute value. We can read it only.
	Permanent : if you use this option , then we can edit this value and whatever we gave new value that is fixed, 
Previous value will not override the  new value which what we gave after doing aggregation and refresh
	Temporary : if we use this option , then we can edit the value of attribute and whatever we gave new value is that is temporary which means after we done aggregation and refresh it will override by previous value

47.After aggregation of one application if you edit the name of the application then, if you try to execute the same aggregation task what will happen ?
Ans: Simply it will gives error called Unknown object:  ,   so you have to select the application which you edited explicitly for executing the task

48. What is connector server ? 
Ans: Connector server is a container which contains the connectors . It can be used for different reasons like , to connect to proprietary system that are not fully accessible from environment and, Connector servers are also used to reach resources that are not reachable over the network, Connector server may also be used for security that placing a connector server near the target resource may provide better security than direct communication.

49.What is the logical application ?
Ans:A Logical application is defined based on the combination of attributes found on one are more existing identityiQ application referred as tires.Logical application accounts are not pulled from External Environment.Logical accounts are created by examining identities.

ANS:

14)what is a searchable attribute?
ANS:Extended attribute can be designated as a searchable,this attributes can be used to filtering and this attribute store the implementation of a specific data of several Object types(link,bundle,application,certification item,.managed attribute,identities)

15)how many searchable attributes default for identity or link or bundle?
